The binary produced works only with the Keepass version used as reference and present on "ext" folder. The current version is 2.48.1.

You need to compile also KeePass with .NET 4.8 and replace the installed one. This step is required because the Windows Runtime library require at least .NET 4.6 instead KeePass is compiled with .NET 4.0.

To install on Keepass, you have to copy the following files into "KeePass Password Safe 2\Plugins" folder:
  - FingerprintPlugin.dll
  - Newtonsoft.Json.dll

# Use:

The first time open the keepass database with MasterPassword.<br>
Now on Tools Men√π is present a new item "Fingerprint".<br>
After you select fingerprint a new window is opened.<br>
Set the MasterPassword on the textbox.<br>
The password is saved locally crypted with DPAPI in AppData\Roaming\KeePassWindowsHelloPlugin\DbMasterKey.dat.<br>

Now when you open Keepass you have to deselect MasterPassword checkbox and select "Key File" with "Fingerprint Key Provider" as provider.
